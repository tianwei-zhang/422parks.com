# Introduction
Millions of people visit Yosemite every year. But few continues eastward to meet this little gem hidden in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Mammoth Lakes, Mono County is a ski town two hours away from the Yosemite National Park. Although having a population of ~8000, it is not your typical small town. What sets Mammoth Lakes apart is its high-class styles and afford prices.

# Where to go
The best to visit Mammoth Lakes is to explore and do what you like. But here is a few suggestions:

## Mono Lake
Mono Lake is one of North America's oldest lakes, formed at least 760,000 years ago. The snowpacks in nearby mountains melt and stream into this endorheic basin. With no outlet, Mono Lake is more salty than the sea.

## Rock Creek Lake (Inyo National Forest)
Inyo National Forest covers 1.9 million acres of protected land with numerous lakes. It offers countless camp grounds and trails to explore the forest and the wilderness.

## Lake Crowley
Crowley Lake is a reservoir on the upper Owens River in southern Mono County, California. Facing east, you can see the snow peaks of the White Mountain in the background.

# Stay
I stayed at Sierra Nevada Resort & Spa. For ~$100 during off-season, it offers 4-star hotel quality like the Westin.

# Eat & Drink
Don't miss out Black Velvet Coffee for your breakfast coffee. The quality of coffee is amazing! They offer seasonal and specialty coffees.
