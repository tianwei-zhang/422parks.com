# Introduction
Crater Lake is the deepest lake in the United States. At 1,943 feet, it is the second deepest in the Western Hemisphere and the ninth deepest in the world. Crater Lake is a recognized scenic wonder surrounded by rolling mountains, volcanic peaks and evergreen forests. It was formed when the volcano, Mount Mazama, collapsed.

# TLDR
* Best to visit is summer due to snow and fog in other seasons
* Start your road trip from San Francisco and drive north on I-5
* Prepare to spend one day at Crater Lake National Park
* Stay at the Crater Lake Lodge inside the park to save time from lining up at the park entrance
* Don't miss out the Volcanic Legacy Scenic Byway nearby
* The main attraction is the Rim Village and the Scenic Rim Drive

# The Diary


If you are starting your road trip from San Francisco, I recommend you driving north on I-5 highway. The view along the way is incredible with snowy mountains and vast forests. You will gaze upon the second highest peak in the Cascade Range, Mount Shasta, soon after you enter Oregon.

You can stop by Lake Siskiyou as a lunch stop.

Due to the elevation (e.g. it is a volcano), there could be a lot of snow at the Crater Lake National Park during winter. Make sure to bring ice scrapper and warm cloth.

The depth of Crater Lake gives it an incredible deep blue color.

Fog is a challenge when visiting Crater Lake. When I visited the Park in May 2019, it was still snowing inside the park! And the fog was so dense that people could not see the lake even standing at the edge of the lake. I would recommend visiting in summer.

After you enjoy the view at Crater Lake, don't forget the [Volcanic Legacy Scenic Byway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_Legacy_Scenic_Byway) nearby. It is a quite and scenic drive dotted with cattle farms, beautiful lagoons, and national forests. I recommend driving at least a portion of it near Crater Lake.

If you are heading back to San Francisco, you can take a detour to visit the Redwood National and States Parks.
