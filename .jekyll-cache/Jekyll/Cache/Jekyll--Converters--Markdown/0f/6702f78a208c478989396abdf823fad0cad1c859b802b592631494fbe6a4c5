  <li>Day 1: Hamarikyu Garden -&gt; Tsukiji Fish Market -&gt; Meiji Shrine</li>

<p>In spite of its close location to China and Korea, Japan is unlike any other east asian countries. Its unique culture, food, and people should be experienced by anyone with capable means.</p>

<p>Before you go to Japan, here is what you need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apply a tourist visa depending on your nationality</li>
  <li>Purchase a JR rail pass before you depart</li>
  <li>Learn some basic Japanese (more on language later)</li>
  <li>Bring your credit card with no foreign transaction fees</li>
</ul>

<p>If it is your first time visiting Japan, plan to visit multiple cities. During my first visit, I visited Tokyto, Nikko, Hakone, Kyoto, and Nara. In this guide, we will focus on Tokyto first. Visit my website for travel guides in other Japanese cities.</p>

<p>After your long flight, you finanlly arrived at Japan! There are a few things that you need to do before heading out to your hotel though. First, exchange/validate your JR rail pass which allows you to get on most shinkansens (high speed rail). Next, purchase a Japanese sim card with a data plan at the airport. Lastly, you have to decide how to get to your hotels. One thing that many people donâ€™t realize is how far away the Tokyoâ€™s airport is to city center. There are three options to get to your hotel:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Taxi (very expensive, ~$200 USD)</li>
  <li>Express train</li>
  <li>Shuttle bus (~$10 USD)
Either train or bus is a good option to get to the city center and to your hotels.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was only staying at Hakone for one day, and it was pouring. If you are looking for an Ryokan, I recommend <a href="www.hakone-koyoi.jp">Hakone Koyoi</a>. Semi open-air bath with a mountain view, good breakfast, and amazing customer service.</p>
