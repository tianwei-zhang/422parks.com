<p>Mount Diablo is one of the highest points in San Francisco Bay Area. It is a great hiking spot and you can even see Sierra Nevada on a clear day!</p>

<p>You can drive directly to the summit. However, the parking is extremely limited. I suggest go there in early morning or weekdays. The drive to the top is incredbly beautiful. Make sure to stop along the way and enjoy the views. Once you are the top, you have a 360 view of the bay area.</p>

<p>On a clear day, you can barely see the Sierra Mountains (e.g. Yosemite).</p>
