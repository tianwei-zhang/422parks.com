<p>The Grand Canyonis a unique place to visit. It is a place that makes men humble. It is a place that displays the grandeur of nature. It is a place that everyone should visit at least once in their lifetime.</p>

    </figcaption></figure>

<p>One of the must-do activities is to watch the sunrise at the Grand Canyon National Park. It is a magic moment. The tips of the cliffs start to glow. As the sun rises, more and more of the canyon bathes in the orange light. The best locations to view sunrise are <strong>Mather Point</strong>, <strong>Yavapai Point</strong>, <strong>Yaki Point</strong>, and <strong>Hopi Point</strong>.</p>

<p>After you enjoy the sunrise at <strong>Mather Point</strong>, walk towards <strong>Yavapai Point</strong>. It is an easy walk with paved trail. With the sun behind you, you get to see the fully glory of the Grand Canyon.</p>

<p>Since you get up early to see the sunrise, you probably wake up early. Rest or take a nap. You can grab lunch at the General Store in <strong>Grand Canyon Market Plaza</strong>.</p>

<p>When you visit Grand Canyon, don’t miss out the <strong>Desert View Drive</strong>. Although Mather Point and Yavapai Point are the most convienient, there are plenty of unique view points along Desert View Drive. The best of them is <strong>Lipan Point</strong>. You can see how the Colorado River has carved down the earth to form the Grand Canyon, of which you wouldn’t see from Mather or Yavapai.</p>

<p>If you are staying the night, don’t miss out on the sunset. The best places to watch sunset are <strong>Lipan Point</strong>, <strong>Mather Point</strong>, <strong>Yavapai Point</strong>, and <strong>Hopi Point</strong>. This will conclude your day at the Grand Canyon.</p>

<p>If you have one more day at Grand Canyon, head to the <strong>Bright Angel Trailhead</strong> on the next morning. Be sure to go there early as parking spots are limited. Bright Angel Trail takes you to the bottom of the canyon. Did I mention that Grand Canyon is one mile deep on average? It is a challenging trail for the average person. Depending on your conditions, you should decide when to head back. Remember, it takes twice as much time to climb up then to go down.</p>

<p>Depending on how far down you go on the Bright Angel Trail, it can take you an entire day. If you have time left, visit the west side of the South Rim. Take the shuttle bus to <strong>Hermits Rest</strong> or walk the trail. You can appreciate how deep the Canyon is on your way to <strong>Trailview Overlook</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h1>

<p>I am not sure words can describe the beauty of Grand Canyon. You have to go there to see it and experience it youself.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For most people, it is probably enough to stay two nights and one day at Grand Canyon National Park</li>
  <li>Temperature can get really low during winter (high 10Fs, low 20Fs), especially at sunrise. Bring your winter cloth</li>
  <li>Because of the elevation, the best view is ~10-15 mins after sunrise</li>
  <li>For sunset, it will be too late to get there at sunset because most of the light will be gone. Be there at least 30 mins before sunset</li>
  <li>For lodging, I stayed at one of the hotels inside the park. Next time, I would probably stay in Tusayan for better food and hotels.</li>
  <li>No LTE connection (AT&amp;T) in most areas</li>
</ul>
