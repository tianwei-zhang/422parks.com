<p>Nikko is a city one hour away from Tokyo. Nikko Tosho-gu (日光東照宮), a shrine built in 1617, is one of the 23 Japanese UNESCO World Heritage Sites. It is an easy spot to miss on your itnary if you don’t know about it. Let’s not let that happen. Here is a complete guide to visit Nikko, Japan.</p>

<h2 id="getting-there">Getting there</h2>
<p>Unless you rent a car, there is really only one to get there: the JR East - Nikko Line. It runs about once every hour. So definitely plan your departure and don’t miss the last train home.</p>

<h2 id="shin-kyo">Shin-kyo</h2>
<p>Once you arrive at the Nikko train station, start walking west towards Shin-kyo. You will already be impressed by the sights along the way.</p>

<p>Shin-kyo translates to “The Sacred Bridge”. According to legend, a priest named Shōdō climbed Mt. Nantai in the year 766 to pray for national prosperity but could not cross the fast flowing Daiya River. Shōdō prayed and a 10 foot tall god named Jinja-Daiou appeared with two snakes twisted around his right arm. Jinja-Daiou released the blue and red snakes and they transformed themselves into a rainbow-like bridge covered with sedge, which Shōdō and his followers could use to cross the river. That is why this bridge is sometimes called Yamasugeno-jabashi, which means the “Snake Bridge of Sedge”.</p>

<h2 id="rinno-ji">Rinno-ji</h2>
<p>After you cross “The Sacred Bridge”, start to explore the temple complex near Rinno-ji. This place is especially beatufil during fall. Nature has turned trees into canvas and leaves into colors. It was one of most amazing sight during my visit to Japan.</p>

<p>Tosho-gu was initially built in 1617 during the Edo period. Five structures at Nikkō Tōshō-gū are categorized as National Treasures of Japan, and three more as Important Cultural Properties. Famous buildings at the Tōshō-gū include the richly decorated Yōmeimon, a gate that is also known as “higurashi-no-mon”. The latter name means that one could look at it until sundown, and not tire of seeing it. Carvings in deep relief, painted in rich colors, decorate the surface of the structure. The next gate is the karamon decorated with white ornaments. Located nearby is a woodcarving of a sleepy cat, “Nemuri-neko”, attributed to Hidari Jingorō.</p>

<p>I’d be suprised if you are not impressed by the beauty of Nikko by now. Continue to explore the temple complex. One of the options is to walk towards Shoyo-en. Don’t rush it. Just take in the view and enjoy this moment.</p>
