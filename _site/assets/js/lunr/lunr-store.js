        "excerpt":"TLDR     Best to visit during summer due to snow and fog in other seasons   Start your roadmap from San Francisco and drive north on I-5   Prepare to spend one day at Crater Lake National Park   Stay at the Crater Lake Lodge inside the park to save time from lining up at the park entrance   Don’t miss out the Volcanic Legacy Scenic Byway nearby   The main atrraction is the Rim Village and the Scenic Rim Drive   The Diary  Crater Lake is the deepest lake in the United States. At 1,943 feet, it is the second deepest in the Western Hemisphere and the ninth deepest in the world. Crater Lake is a recognized scenic wonder surrounded by rolling mountains, volcanic peaks and evergreen forests. It was formed when the volcano, Mount Mazama, collapsed.   If you are starting your roadtrip from San Francisco, I recommend you driving north on I-5 highway. The view along the way is incredible with snowy mountains and vast forests. You will gaze upon the second highest peak in the Cascade Range, Mount Shasta, soon after you enter Oregon.             Mt Shasta        You can stop by Lake Siskiyou as a lunch stop.   Due to the elevation (e.g. it is a volcano), there could be a lot of snow at the Craker Lake National Park. Make sure to bring ice scrapper and warm cloth.            Visitor Center at Crater Lake National Park        The depth of Crater Lake gives it an incredible deep blue color.            Crater Lake                  Fog is a challenge when visiting Crater Lake. When I visited the Park in May 2019, it was still snowing inside the park! And the fog was so dense that people could not see the lake even standing at the edge of the lake. I would recommend visiting in summer.   After you enjoy the view at Crater Lake, don’t forget the Volcanic Legacy Scenic Byway nearby. It is a quite and scenic drive dotted with cattle farms, beautiful lagoons, and national forests. I recommend driving at least a portion of it near Crater Lake.

It is unlike any other places that I have been to. It allows me to appreciate nature’s grandness and recognize men’s triviality. Everyone should visit Grand Canyon National Park at least once in their lifetimes.             Sunrise at Mather Point        Sunrise at Grand Canyon is a magical moment. The tips of the cliffs start to glow. As the sun rises, the entire canyon bathes in the orange sunlight. The best locations to view sunrise are Mather Point, Yavapai Point, Yaki Point, and Hopi Point.   After you enjoy the sunrise at Mather Point, walk towards Yavapai Point. It is an easy walk with paved trail. With the sun behind you, you get to see the fully glory of the Grand Canyon.        Since you get up early to see the sunrise, you probably wake up early. Rest or take a nap. You can grab lunch at the General Store in Grand Canyon Market Plaza.   When you visit Grand Canyon, don’t miss out the Desert View Drive. Although Mather Point and Yavapai Point are the most convienient, there are plenty of unique view points along Desert View Drive. The best of them is Lipan Point. You can see how the Colorado River has carved down the earth to form the Grand Canyon, of which you wouldn’t see from Mather or Yavapai.             Lipan Point        If you are staying one more night, don’t miss out on the sunset. The best places to watch sunset are Lipan Point, Mather Point, Yavapai Point, and Hopi Point. This will conclude your day at the Grand Canyon.   If you have one more day at Grand Canyon, head to the Bright Angel Trailhead on the next morning. Be sure to go there early as parking spots are limited. Bright Angel Trail takes you to the bottom of the canyon. Did I mention that Grand Canyon is one mile deep on average? It is a challenge trail for the average person. Depending on your conditions, you should decide when to head back. Remember, it takes twice as much time to climb up then go down.   Depending on how far down you go on the Bright Angel Trail, it can take you an entire day. If you have time left, visit the west side of the South Rim. Take the shuttle bus to Hermits Rest or walk the trail. You can appreciate how deep the Canyon is on your way to Trailview Overlook.   Final Thoughts   I am not sure words can describe the beauty of Grand Canyon. You have to go there to see it and experience it youself.      For most people, it is probably enough to stay two nights and one day at Grand Canyon National Park   Temperature can get really low during winter (high 10Fs, low 20Fs), especially at sunrise. Bring your winter cloth   Because of the elevation, the best view is ~10-15 mins after sunrise   For sunset, it will be too late to get there at sunset because most of the light will be gone. Be there at least 30 mins before sunset   For lodging, I stayed at one of the hotels inside the park. Next time, I would probably stay in Tusayan for better food and hotels.
