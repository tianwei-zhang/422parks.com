        "excerpt":"Crater Lake with its incredibly blue water is the deepest lake in the United States. At 1,943 feet, it is the second deepest in the Western Hemisphere and the ninth deepest in the world. Crater Lake is a recognized scenic wonder surrounded by rolling mountains, volcanic peaks and evergreen forests. The cinder cone in the lake, known as Wizard Island, rises 763 feet above the water.   I started the journey from San Fransisco and drove north on I-5. Once I was near Oregon, the scenery was incredible with snowy peaks and vast redwood forests. Mt. Shasta, the second-highest peak in the Cascade Range, was especially breathtaking. You can see it while on highway I-5.             Mt Shasta                       Crater Lake                  When I first arrived at the Crater Lake National Park, it started snowing at the end of May! Just moved from Boston to San Fransisco, I reunited with winter snows after 9 months. Luckily, I still had my snow brush in my car and was able to clean 7 inches of snow. It was extremely foggy after a whole night of snowing; I couldn’t see the lake at all even standing just at the edge of the lake! Luckily, Oregon is incredibly beautiful. I especially recommend driving The Volcanic Legacy Scenic Byway. It is roughly 500 miles long and the section near Crater Lake National Park is dotted with cattle farms, beautiful lagoons, and national forests.                            Driving through Umpqua National Forest        On my way back, I took a detour to visit the Redwood National and States Parks.

It is unlike any other places that I have been to. It allows me to appreciate nature’s grandness and recognize men’s triviality. Everyone should visit Grand Canyon National Park at least once in their lifetimes.             Sunrise at Mather Point        Sunrise at Grand Canyon is a magical moment. The tips of the cliffs start to glow. As the sun rises, the entire canyon bathes in the orange sunlight. The best locations to view sunrise are Mather Point, Yavapai Point, Yaki Point, and Hopi Point.   After you enjoy the sunrise at Mather Point, walk towards Yavapai Point. It is an easy walk with paved trail. With the sun behind you, you get to see the fully glory of the Grand Canyon.        Since you get up early to see the sunrise, you probably wake up early. Rest or take a nap. You can grab lunch at the General Store in Grand Canyon Market Plaza.   When you visit Grand Canyon, don’t miss out the Desert View Drive. Although Mather Point and Yavapai Point are the most convienient, there are plenty of unique view points along Desert View Drive. The best of them is Lipan Point. You can see how the Colorado River has carved down the earth to form the Grand Canyon, of which you wouldn’t see from Mather or Yavapai.             Lipan Point        If you are staying one more night, don’t miss out on the sunset. The best places to watch sunset are Lipan Point, Mather Point, Yavapai Point, and Hopi Point. This will conclude your day at the Grand Canyon.   If you have one more day at Grand Canyon, head to the Bright Angel Trailhead on the next morning. Be sure to go there early as parking spots are limited. Bright Angel Trail takes you to the bottom of the canyon. Did I mention that Grand Canyon is one mile deep on average? It is a challenge trail for the average person. Depending on your conditions, you should decide when to head back. Remember, it takes twice as much time to climb up then go down.   Depending on how far down you go on the Bright Angel Trail, it can take you an entire day. If you have time left, visit the west side of the South Rim. Take the shuttle bus to Hermits Rest or walk the trail. You can appreciate how deep the Canyon is on your way to Trailview Overlook.   Final Thoughts   I am not sure words can describe the beauty of Grand Canyon. You have to go there to see it and experience it youself.      For most people, it is probably enough to stay two nights and one day at Grand Canyon National Park   Temperature can get really low during winter (high 10Fs, low 20Fs), especially at sunrise. Bring your winter cloth   Because of the elevation, the best view is ~10-15 mins after sunrise   For sunset, it will be too late to get there at sunset because most of the light will be gone. Be there at least 30 mins before sunset   For lodging, I stayed at one of the hotels inside the park. Next time, I would probably stay in Tusayan for better food and hotels.

        "title": "Vancouver",
        "excerpt":"In April 2017, I visited Vancouver, BC for the first time to stamp my H1B visa, traveling solo. It was a wonderful trip. I fell in love with the scenic views of the Pacific Ocean and Canadian Rocky Mountain.   I stayed at the Sheraton Wall Centre for a week, and got upgrade to a junior suite. The view was fantastic, with windows facing both the ocean and the Rocky Mountain. I also loved their free food in the lounge. It was the best Sheraton I had stayed so far.   In this blog, I will detail the places I visited. It serves as a place for holding my memory and a potential guide for future Vancouver visitors.             Places visited in Vancouver    The first place I visited is Canada Place. It is a riverside walk with beautiful view to the Rocky Mountain.             Apartment buildings near Canada Place              View of the Canadian Rocky Mountain              Canada Place                    Next, I headed up north to visit the beautiful Standley Park, one of the largest metropolitan parks in North America. I walked 5 hours for a complete route. I highly recommend renting a bike. The view is amazing but it gets repetitive after the first hour.                                                                   During my trip, I had to visit the US consulate for my visa interview so I did not visit one place after another. I spent half-day in Canada Place and a whole day in Standley Park (did not rent a bike). Luckily, there are several good restaurants near Standley Park after a long day of walking.   Next, I took a ferry to Granville Island. It is a fun place with shops for snacks and souvenirs. Coming from the US, I did not find the merchandise there particularly interesting.   My next stop was ‎⁨Capilano Provincial Park⁩. It is outside of the city; you can take a bus or a taxi to get there. The park is well-maintained and the gardeners carefully arrange the plants to create photogenic views. There is an entrance fee (~$50?) but it is well worth it. It is a must-visit for outdoor lovers!                                                                                        I probably spent an entire afternoon in Capilano park. There are so many spots to take beautiful photos; it is a photographer’s heaven.   For the next attraction, I headed south from Sheraton Wall Centre and visited ‎⁨Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden⁩. Being a Chinese, I have visited many classical Chinese gardens in southern China. Dr. Sun Yat-Sen’s Garden closely resembles the scholar gardens I saw in Hangzhou and Suzhou, China. I was impressed to see such a classical Chinese building outside of China. The entrance fee is quite cheap. I suggest spend an hour or two in this location.                                                    I also visited University of British Columbia and Queen Elizabeth’s park. Both are nice and worth a visit if you have time.   At the end of this blog, I want to tell you my favorite place in Vancouver and how I found it. I was heading to the shopping district, and stumbled upon an old-looking bookstore. Looking through the glass windows, my first impression was the magical bookstore Flourish &amp; Blotts from Diagon Alley (Harry Potter). I am a big fun of old books, and I had to go in. It is a quiet bookstore without many people around. There are books on the shelf, piled up on the floor, and locked away in the basement. I picked up my first book, turned to the first page, and it was published in 1930s. It is a book older than my grandparent! There are many books older than 100 years in that store. I bought a set of History of England by James Anthony Froude. The name of the bookstore is MacLeod’s Books.          At last, I want to share some beautiful views from my hotel room at Sheraton Wall Centre. Thank you for reading!                       ","categories": [],

        "title": "Vancouver Visit #2",
        "excerpt":"I fell in love with Vancouver when I visited it the first time in 2017. When I visited this place again, it was during a period of stress and frustration. The Pacific Ocean, the Canadian Mountains, and the great British Columbia calmed my mind and let me forget about work and enjoy the gift nature has offered to us.   If you are visiting Vancouver for the first time, you can find my itinerary in an earlier post. For this visit, I rented a car (Jeep Wrangler) for 7 days and stayed at the Sheraon Wall Centre.             Places visited    The first place I have to recommend is Sea-to-Sky Gondola. When I first heard about it, I simply thought it is a Gondola that takes you to the top of a mountain. It is much more than that. It does take you to a viewing platform which offers a great view to the Sky Pilot Mountain and Mt Habrich. You can also enjoy multiple well marked and maintained trails in the mountain. I easily spent 2-3 hours taking pictures and completing two easy trails. But you can take as much as you want to enjoy the breathtaking view.            Mt Sky Pilot                    Sea-to-Sky Gondola Platform                                           One of the trails in Sea-to-Sky Gondola             Looking at Squamish, BC              Shannon Falls Park near Squamish, BC    The next place I recommend is the Sea-to-Sky Highway (Highway 99 West) and the surrounding areas near Whistler. You can access Whistler by Highway 99 West. Sea-to-Sky Gondola is a great midway stop on your way to Whistler. Unless you are a fan of skiing, the Olympic Village in Whistler is not worth a visit. It is a very commercial area with live music and hotels. However, the surrounding parks are peaceful and have great views.             Railway near Rainbow Park    Along Highway 99 West, there are marked viewing stops. Look for those signs and you will be rewarded with amazing views.                        A quintessential thing to do in Vancouver is to climb the Grouse Grind, a hiking trail with 2,800 feet elevation gain. Unfortunately, it was closed for spring maintenance during my visit. So definitely check out its opening hours before you plan the visit.   A few other places I visited are Horseshoe Bay, Capilano River Regional Park, Gold Ear Park, and Lighthouse Park. I witnessed a wedding happening in Capilano River Regional Park. Imagine taking a vow in front of a wooden frame covered by white flowers, with the Great British Columbia as the perfect backdrop. That was a fantastic location for a wedding!             Capilano River Regional Park              Horseshoe Bay   ","categories": [],

For most people, it is probably enough to stay two nights and one day at Grand Canyon National Park   Temperature can get really low during winter (high 10Fs, low 20Fs), especially at sunrise. Bring your winter cloth   Because of the elevation, the best view is ~10-15 mins after sunrise   For sunset, it will be too late to get there at sunset because most of the light will be gone. Be there at least 30 mins before sunset   For lodging, I stayed at one of the hotels inside the park. Next time, I would probably stay in Tusayan for better food and hotels.   No LTE connection (AT&amp;T) in most areas                                                         ","categories": [],
